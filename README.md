# Better Rails Secrets Manager üîê

A beautiful web interface for managing Rails secrets and credentials across ALL environments. Features both a **visual form editor** and YAML editor - no more wrestling with terminal editors or worrying about YAML syntax!

## üé® Two Editing Modes

### Form Editor (NEW!)
- **Visual Interface**: Add/edit secrets using a clean form interface
- **Organized Sections**: Group related secrets into sections (e.g., AWS, Stripe, Database)
- **Dynamic Fields**: Add/remove fields and sections on the fly
- **No YAML Syntax**: The form handles all formatting for you
- **Type Safety**: Prevents YAML syntax errors

### YAML Editor
- **Syntax Highlighting**: CodeMirror-powered editor with YAML syntax highlighting
- **Direct Control**: Edit raw YAML when you need precise control
- **Validation**: Built-in YAML validation

## üîí Security Model

- **Development Environment Only**: The web interface only loads when Rails.env.development? is true
- **File-Based Organization**: Credentials are organized by actual file names, not assumed environments
- **Key-Based Access**: If you have the encryption keys, you have access to the secrets
- **Rails Native Security**: Uses Rails' built-in encryption system for all operations

## ‚ú® Features

- **Beautiful Web Interface**: Modern, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS
- **Form-Based Editor**: Visual interface for managing secrets without touching YAML
- **ALL Environments**: Edit any credential file from one interface
- **Smart Sections**: Organize secrets into logical groups (database, APIs, services)
- **Dynamic Management**: Add/remove fields and sections on the fly
- **YAML Editor Option**: Switch to raw YAML editing when needed
- **Environment Switching**: Easily switch between credential files with one click
- **Import/Export**: Backup and restore secrets in JSON format
- **Rails Native**: Works seamlessly with Rails' built-in credentials system
- **File-Based Discovery**: Automatically detects all credential files in your project
- **Secure by Design**: Only accessible in development environment with proper keys

## üì¶ Installation

Add this gem to your Rails application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'better_rails_secrets_manager'
end
```

Then execute:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Run the installation generator:

```bash
$ rails generate better_rails_secrets_manager:install
```

This will:
- Mount the engine at `/secrets` (development only)
- Create an initializer for configuration

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Start your Rails server in development:
   ```bash
   rails server
   ```

2. Visit http://localhost:3000/secrets

3. Edit secrets for ANY environment (dev, staging, production) - as long as you have the encryption keys!

## üé® Features in Detail

### Form Editor (Default)
- **Visual Fields**: Add secrets using input fields - no YAML knowledge required
- **Sections**: Organize related secrets (e.g., all AWS keys in one section)
- **Dynamic Controls**: 
  - Click "+ Add Field" for simple key-value pairs
  - Click "+ Add Section" to create grouped secrets
  - Remove any field or section with the √ó button
- **Auto-Formatting**: The form automatically generates proper YAML structure
- **Error Prevention**: No more YAML syntax errors or indentation issues

### YAML Editor (Advanced)
- **Syntax Highlighting**: CodeMirror-powered editor with YAML support
- **Direct Editing**: Full control over the YAML structure
- **Validation**: Check your YAML syntax before saving
- **Format Button**: Auto-format your YAML with proper indentation
- **Switch Modes**: Toggle between form and YAML views anytime

### File-Based Organization
- **Automatic Discovery**: Finds all credential files in your project
- **Clear Naming**: Shows actual file names (credentials.yml.enc ‚Üí "Main Credentials")
- **Independent Files**: Each credential file is completely separate
- **No Assumptions**: Doesn't assume what each file is for

### Import/Export
- **JSON Export**: Export secrets to JSON for backup or sharing
- **Timestamped Exports**: Each export includes timestamp for versioning
- **Easy Import**: Import secrets from JSON files with validation
- **Environment-Specific**: Import/export is per-environment

### Developer Experience
- **Form-First Design**: Default to the easy form editor, with YAML as an option
- **Single Interface**: Edit ALL credential files from one place
- **No YAML Headaches**: Form editor eliminates indentation and syntax errors
- **Section Organization**: Group related secrets logically
- **No External Dependencies**: Everything runs locally
- **Rails Integration**: Works with your existing Rails credentials
- **Key Management**: Automatically manages encryption keys

## üìù Usage Examples

### Using the Form Editor

1. **Adding a simple secret**:
   - Click "+ Add Field"
   - Enter key: `secret_key_base`
   - Enter value: `your-secret-value`
   - Click "Save Secrets"

2. **Creating a section for AWS credentials**:
   - Click "+ Add Section"
   - Enter section name: `aws`
   - Click "+ Add field to aws"
   - Add your AWS keys:
     - `access_key_id`: `AKIA...`
     - `secret_access_key`: `your-secret`
     - `region`: `us-east-1`

3. **Organizing database credentials**:
   ```
   Section: database
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ host: localhost
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ username: myapp
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ password: secure_password
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pool: 5
   ```

### Result in YAML

The form editor automatically generates clean YAML:

```yaml
secret_key_base: your-secret-value

aws:
  access_key_id: AKIA...
  secret_access_key: your-secret
  region: us-east-1

database:
  host: localhost
  username: myapp
  password: secure_password
  pool: 5
```

## üîß Configuration

Configure in `config/initializers/better_rails_secrets_manager.rb`:

```ruby
BetterRailsSecretsManager.configure do |config|
  # No authentication needed - if you have the keys, you have access
  config.authentication_enabled = false
  
  # Configure allowed environments for your project
  config.allowed_environments = %w[development test staging production custom]
end
```

### Required Keys

To edit secrets for each environment, you need:
- **Production**: `config/master.key`
- **Other environments**: `config/credentials/[environment].key`

If you don't have a key for an environment, you won't be able to decrypt/edit its secrets.

## üìÅ How It Works

The gem works with Rails' native credentials system:

- **Development**: `config/credentials/development.yml.enc`
- **Test**: `config/credentials/test.yml.enc`
- **Staging**: `config/credentials/staging.yml.enc`
- **Production**: `config/credentials.yml.enc`
- **Custom**: `config/credentials/[name].yml.enc`

Each environment has its own encryption key:
- `config/credentials/[environment].key`
- Production uses `config/master.key`

## üñºÔ∏è UI Overview

The interface includes:

1. **Sidebar**
   - Environment list with active indicator
   - Add new environment form
   - Quick environment switcher

2. **Main Panel**
   - Current secrets display (masked values)
   - Edit button for modification
   - Visual tree structure for nested secrets

3. **Import/Export Section**
   - Export current environment to JSON
   - Import from JSON file
   - Maintains backup history

4. **Editor View**
   - Syntax-highlighted YAML editor
   - Format and validate buttons
   - Save and cancel actions

## üîê Security Architecture

### Why Development Environment Only?

The web interface only loads when `Rails.env.development?` is true. This provides:

1. **Reduced Attack Surface**: The UI doesn't exist in production servers
2. **Development Workflow**: Use locally to manage ALL environments
3. **Key-Based Security**: You can only decrypt environments you have keys for
4. **Simplified Access**: No additional passwords - keys are the authentication
5. **No Network Exposure**: Typically only accessible on localhost

### Managing Production Secrets

From your development machine, you can safely edit production secrets:

1. Ensure you have the production master key locally
2. Start the Rails app in development mode
3. Login with your password
4. Switch to "production" environment in the UI
5. Edit and save (changes are encrypted with the production key)

The production servers never expose the web interface, but you can manage their secrets from your secure development environment.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Can't access `/secrets`?
- Ensure you're running in development mode (`Rails.env.development?` must be true)
- Check if the route is mounted: `rails routes | grep secrets`
- Restart your Rails server after installation

### Secrets not saving?
- Check file permissions on `config/credentials/` directory
- Ensure the key file exists for the environment you're editing
- For production: ensure `config/master.key` is present
- For other environments: ensure `config/credentials/[env].key` exists
- Check Rails logs for detailed error messages

### Environment not showing?
- Verify the environment name is valid (alphanumeric and underscores)
- Check if credentials file was created successfully
- Try restarting the Rails server
